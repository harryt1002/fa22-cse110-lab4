1. Line 12 will rpint out the value of the counter i since it was declared as a var. Because it was delcared as a var, the scope is within the function.
2. Line 13 will print 150. discountedPrice is a variable declared as a var so its scope is within the function.
3. Line 14 will print 150. finalPrice is a variable declared as a var so its scope is within the function.
4. This function will return an array with the discounted prices. The code loops through the prices array and calculates a discounted price. The code has no errors in terms of variables since all of them were declared as a var which means the scope is within the function.
5. Line 12 will return an error. The variable i was declared as a let which the scope in only within the for loop block.
6. Line 13 will also return an error since discountedPrice is a let variable so its block scope is only within the for loop.
7. Line 14 will print out the value of finalPrice since the scope of the variable is the entire function where as the previous 2 questions the variable scopes were of the for loop.
8. The function will return the array of discounted prices as the variables scope is of the entire function.
9. The code causes an error since the scope of variable i is only that of the for loop.
10. Line 12 will print out "3" as the scope of const length is that of the function
11. The function will return the array of discounted prices. This works because you can still push items into a const array.
